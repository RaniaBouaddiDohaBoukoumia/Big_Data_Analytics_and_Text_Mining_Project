### Project Highlights
1. Problem Description:

 * Predicting diabetes prevalence using health indicators such as BMI, blood pressure, and lifestyle factors.
 * Objectives include building interpretable and accurate models to identify key risk factors.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

 * Visualizations and descriptive statistics to understand the data and identify key trends.
3. Model Training:

 * Evaluated several machine learning algorithms:
     * Logistic Regression
     * Random Forest
     * Gradient Boosting
     * XGBoost
     * Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
4. Results:

 * Gradient Boosting and XGBoost were the best-performing models.
 * XGBoost was selected as the final model for its robustness, scalability, and interpretability.
5. Conclusions:

 * Highlighted key health factors influencing diabetes and provided actionable insights for early detection.
